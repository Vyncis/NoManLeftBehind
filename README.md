# No Man Left Behind

Description: Starsector mod designed around exploration and fleshing out the decivilised condition.

## Explanation of Folders/Files

- `.git/` Optional. Used by git to store all git-related information. May be deleted if you are not using git.
- `.idea/` Required. Used by IntelliJ to store settings and configuration.
- `.run/` Optional. Used by IntelliJ, contains a ready-to-use configuration for running the game. May be deleted if you
  want to make your own Run Configuration instead.
- `data/` Optional. Used by Starsector, this folder just contains some common files that mods use that you would
  probably end up creating yourself. May be deleted if you don't need it.
- `src/` Optional? Contains example source code which you will presumably build upon. May be deleted if your mod doesn't
  have any code (but then why use this template...?)
- `.gitignore` Optional. Used by git to determine which files should not be committed (for example, not to commit temp
  files used during the build process). May be deleted if not using git.
- `LICENSE` Optional. This is the license file, delete or modify it to your liking.
- `mod_info.json` Required.
- `README.md` Required?
- `yourName_uniqueid.version` Optional. This is a sample Version Checker file. May be deleted if not using Version
  Checker (but you should).
